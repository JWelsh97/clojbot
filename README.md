# clojbot

A simple IRC bot. The bot used the core.async libraries and CPS communication between the bot and modules. The entire idea of this tiny framework is to facilitate easy module management. It is still a work in progress.

## Usage

`lein run`. Be sure to configure the bot properly in `core.clj`.
